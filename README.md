## About project

My application uses the idea and rules – Game of life, created by the British mathematician John Conway. The game is played on an board divided into square cells. 

Each cell has eight "neighbors", that is cells adjacent to it with sides and corners. Each cell can be in one of two states: it can be either "alive" (black color) or "dead" (white color). 

Cell states change in units of time (“next generation”) that the user can define after starting the application.

## Game rules

- A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive in the next unit of time  (“next generation”);

- A living cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors remains alive - with a different number of neighbors, it dies.

## Game options
- Size of the game board and the next generation interval you can set by slider;

- At the beginning or any other time, you can change the state of cells - just click on them, or use Randomly button to generate “alive” cells;

- Next generation will change automatically when you press Start button or when you press Next Generation button;

- You can save and load game status by select option from the Game label at the top of application.
